# Dank-Memer-Autofarm
An advanced yet simple Autofarm, by [P3ter](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBnu_694dyDx8qz77Pxr-1A).


## Things to take into consideration:
- The file might be flagged as a Virus, but it's all just False Positive flags.
  - Reasons:
    - It was converted into an exe using Pyinstaller. [Click Here](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/603) to see why Pyinstaller exe's are flagged as Viruses.
    - It's not licensed by Microsoft, and that costs money, so I'm not going to license it.
    - It hasn't been downloaded on enough devices in order to be trusted by Anti-Virus programs.
- You might have to disable your AntiVirus in order to download the file.
  - If you feel like it's sketchy or too dangerous, simply don't download it. No one is forcing you.
- If any bug was found - though I'm pretty sure I fixed them all - please report them at my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ZFbVsgk2Qf).

## Usage:
- Double click **`AutoFarm.exe`**
- To enable an option, just click it.
  - Green means it's enabled.
  - Red means it's disabled.
- To start, click the **`Start`** button.
  - Aleternativly, to stop, click the red **`Stop`** button.
    - (It shows when the Autofarm is enabled.)
